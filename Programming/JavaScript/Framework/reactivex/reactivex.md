[**ReactiveX**](http://reactivex.io/) is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.

It mainly extends [the observer pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) to support composing sequences together without concerning about low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety, concurrent data structures, and non-blocking I/O.

The author of Rx has claimed that Rx can not be called as "functional reactive programming", as it only operates on *isolated* values that are emitted over time, but not on values that change *continuously* over time.

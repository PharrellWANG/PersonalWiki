## Environment Setup [Back](./../angular1.md)

Firstly, clone the [angular-phonecat repository](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat) located at GitHub by running the following command:

```bash
git clone --depth=16 https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat.git
```

> the `--depth=16` option tells Git to pull down only the last 16 commits, which make it faster to download

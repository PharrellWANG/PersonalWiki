## Asynchronous Programming [Back](./../JavaScript.md)

### 1. Introduction

As JavaScript is almost run in a thread, and its executing blocks the UI thread at the same time, resulting in a really "disastrous" user experience, asynchronous programming allows developers to write code in a asynchronous way to improve performance of JavaScript code. It also means that the skill can make great use of CPU resources to prevent from wasting calculation units.

It's asynchronous, but remember that it does not mean to use multiple threads.
